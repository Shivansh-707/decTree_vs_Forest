# Wine Classification using Decision Tree and Random Forest

This project demonstrates the use of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers for multiclass classification on the UCI Wine dataset. The aim is to compare the performance of both models after hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and evaluate their effectiveness through cross-validation and test accuracy.

## Features
- Uses scikit-learn's built-in Wine dataset
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
- 5-fold cross-validation for performance evaluation
- Accuracy comparison and confusion matrix visualization

## Requirements
